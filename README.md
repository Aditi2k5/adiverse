WELCOME TO ADIVERSE
This is my personal portfolio website with an 80s inspired game-themed platform with pixelated images, matrix inspired terminal wrtitten resume, gaming type animations, neon writing and much more. 
It has been made using NextJS, Typescript, TialwindCSS and Shadcn Ui for the overall look and UI of the website.

Made for the Codedex Holiday Hackathon for Track 2 'Now It's Personal', it delivers a functional prototype with a list of journey, skills, activities and a lot more.

Explore ADIVERSE and be taken back to the 80s with nostalgia.
